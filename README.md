## Comments

### Possible additions

Recomend by most watched genre:
  - I started working on this but thought as it wasn't nessasary I would focus on the needed functionality

### Possible changes

Making the packages com.experis.PACKAGE_NAME to show the convention for naming, I decided not to do that as I uploaded this to [github](https://github.com/Dyroha/MovieCase/tree/development) and though putting someone else's domain would be inpropper.
